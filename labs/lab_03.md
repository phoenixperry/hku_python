## Lab 3: 
 
##### Naming conventions 

Put all of your homework files together into one folder, zip it and email it to your lab assistant with your name_the week.zip 

** Make the subject of the email "lab 2" **

**for example:** 
phoenixperry_02.zip


##### Due Date 

Turn each lab no later than 24 hours after the lab session. 

##### Grading Matrix 

Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.
*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|
*Delivery* | The program was delivered on time. | The program was delivered within a week of the due date. | The code was within 2 weeks of the due date. | The code was more than 2 weeks overdue but no later than 3 weeks overdue. |
*Attendance* | You attended the lab. | You attended the lab but came late or left early. | You emailed your work in ahead of time but did not attend the lab. | You did not attend and you turned your work in on time |

**After 3 weeks, you immediately get a fail for this lab. 


##Exercise 1_0 
Write a program that asks the user their lucky number between 0-11. Test if the user give it something other than a number. If they do enter a string, tell them that they need to enter a number instead. Once the program has a number, predict the user's future in any way you want.  

Sample output: 

`What's your lucky number?` 

`You entered in 3. That's a great choice! In 3 days you'll meet a black cat on your way to HKU. If you can get the cat to let you pet it,  you'll have good luck for the whole semester.`

Also, check the class notes! 


##Exercise 1_1 
Create a program that prints the odd numbers in the range between 0 - 100

##Exercise 1_2  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `high` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `five`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `highfive`.

Hint: To solve this puzzle you'll need to use the modulus operator. 

####Are you lost? 
SPEAK UP! We will help you I promise. Don't let this drag on and you are not alone! :) 
Programming is crazy hard the first time you learn about it.
 
Why not give this site a try. It's super awesome and very clear.http://www.learnpython.org 


####Are you bored? 
Let's learn some unix! 

Are you on Windows? Install a system environmental variable for python 
Install Unix for Windows 
https://www.cygwin.com/ 

On a mac? Figure out how to make python control the mac os. Create a file on your desktop called "made_from_python" 

https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html 

Both groups: compile a python file from the command line! :)
