##### Naming conventions 

Put all of your homework files together into one folder, zip it and email it to your lab assistant with your name_the week.zip 

** Make the subject of the email "lab 2" **

**for example:** 
phoenixperry_02.zip


##### Due Date 

Turn each lab no later than 24 hours after the lab session. 

##### Grading Matrix 

Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.
*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|
*Delivery* | The program was delivered on time. | The program was delivered within a week of the due date. | The code was within 2 weeks of the due date. | The code was more than 2 weeks overdue but no later than 3 weeks overdue. 

**After 3 weeks, you immediately get a fail for this lab. 


##Exercise 1_0 
Write a program that asks the user's age. Compute the users age in 5 years. Tell them how old they will be in 5 years as a sentence. 

Sample output: 

```In five years you will be 25 years old``` 

---
##Exercise 1_1 

Ask the user how many years old they are. 
Ask the user months until their birthday. 
Compute how many days old they are and print it out as a string. 

Sample output: 

```You are 9125 days old``` 

##Exercise 1_2  
Download Processing and make a fun drawing. Hand in your final drawing. 

***GET AN OLDER VERSION! The latest is unstable. DO NOT UPDATE. It'll prompt you to do that when you first open the older version- click ignore.*** 
**Download version 2.2.1 **

Follow this guide to run and create your first sketch

A quick tip is that the dropdown to add a mode is in the upper left hand corner of the processing IDE.

*Note: the color is in RGB color space. The first values represent red, green and blue. You can get RGB values out of tools like photoshop*

Just pay attention to the RGB values. Ignore everything else. 

####A quick note on the global prefix. 

If you want to use a variable that's declared outside a function in a function, you'll need to set it to be used in the function using the global keyword.  Sorry I didn't remember this on Monday. It's been a minute since I last tried to do this in this kind of way. I tend to do this in another way that I promise to tell you soon. 

For an example of how to do this look here: https://github.com/phoenixperry/hku_python/blob/master/class_code/week02/global_variable%20_example/global_variables.py

(Hint: you can do it with objects or pass the values in for fancy folks.)

Modifying a global variable inside a function isn't a great practice to get into but it'll work for now with a better solution coming soon. Generally, it's a best practice to never change a global variable inside a function but to *return* a value, which the way raw_input does. More info coming soon on this functionally.  

####Are you lost? 
SPEAK UP! We will help you I promise. Don't let this drag on and you are not alone! :) 
Programming is crazy hard the first time you learn about it.
