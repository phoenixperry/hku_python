#####Course Videos: Python for Everybody 

http://www.pythonlearn.com

This class will run during the term for free on Coursera here 

https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn 

Sign up for it. It will not start until Oct 15th but all materials are linked above in the first link so we can start a bit earlier. After the 15th you can participate online in the forums and his sites though and use his auto grader for assignments.  

These videos use a different IDE than we’ll use in class. You can just use ours for both, or his or both. Totally up to you for video only content. You just have to turn in .py files for your assignments. 

Dr. Chuck has an online code grader that should help you out which is awesome. Actually, his ideas are what code academy is build off of.  His online TED Talk  is awesome and about the class you will follow online.

#####Other optional online learning systems for people how don't like longer videos x

Resources: 

1. Learn Python 
Why not give this site a try. It's super awesome and very clear and gives you immediate code feedback.http://www.learnpython.org  


2. Code Academy  

Note: Only valid the first few weeks - lots this class in not here. This of this as a tide over until the coursea course starts up if you want something to grade your code as you go:

####Grading: 

* Midterm - 20% of the final grade 
* Labwork - 40% of the final grade 
* Final Exam - 40% of the final grade The homework assignments are required and will consist of programming assignments.

###Labs
Each week there will be a lab assignment here in a folder called lab

You are required to attend the lab session listed in your schedule. If you miss more than 3 labs, you must provide a valid reason. More than 3 absences is unacceptable. You will need to do make up work should you miss this many labs. See your lab instructor for more information. There you need to you your lab work independently.
